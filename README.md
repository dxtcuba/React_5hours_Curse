Theese are all the examples codes from the 5 hours React free curse of Bob Ziroll...
In my opinion i belive it has been a great curse for someone who plans to start learning ReactJS from older frameworks like JQuery.

SCRIMBA ==> https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact/

**I recommend to use scrimba due to some updates the author drops into the curse as the time goes
Enjoy!
